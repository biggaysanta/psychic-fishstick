# psychic-fishstick

## I was eating ##
a slice of</br> 
*pineapple upside down cake*
<p>and was struck by the thought:
<p><strong>I want some fishsticks and tartar sauce.</strong></p>

## opening the freezer,
<p>i discovered<br/>
i was bereft of fishsticks,</br>
and tartar sauce was nowhere to be found!</br>
a whale of a moan eacaped my lips,</br>
soon to be replaced by</br>
the emanence of a <em>psychic kind</em>

<p><em>we are are here, we are here</em></br>
the fish sticks beckoned,</br>
<em>swimming in a pool</br> 
of tartar sauce and lemon</em>

<p>i dashed to the market</br>
but the freezers were bare</br>
and i fell like napoleon at Waterloo</br>
*able was I 'ere I saw Elba, indeed*
<p>or maybe 'twas but a figment</p>

## and i finished my
<p>pineapple upside down cake,</br>
drank my coffee</br>
and resumed coding
