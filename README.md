# psychic-fishstick

I was eating a slice of 
pineapple upside down cake
and was struck by the thought: 
I want some fishsticks and tartar sauce.

opening the freezer,
i discovered
i was bereft of fishsticks,
and tartar sauce eas nowhere to be found
a whale of a moan eacapedmy lips,
soon to be replaced by
the emanence of a psychic kind

*we are here, we are here
The fish sticks beckoned,
swimming in a pool 
of tartar sauce and lemon*

i dashed to the market
but the freezers were bare
and i fell like napoleon at Waterloo

---

or maybe 'twas but a figment

and i finished my
pineapple upside down cake
drank my coffee
and resumed coding
