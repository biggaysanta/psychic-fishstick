## What is the Rotator Cuff?

The rotator cuff comprises four muscles: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. These muscles work harmoniously to stabilize the shoulder joint and enable various arm movements, such as lifting, rotating, and reaching.

### Supraspinatus Muscle

![](images/scapula-rear-view-sup-hl-150x150.jpg)

**Origin**: The supraspinatus muscle originates from the supraspinous fossa of the scapula.

**Insertion**: It inserts onto the greater tubercle of the humerus.

**Action**: The supraspinatus initiates abduction of the arm and assists in stabilizing the shoulder joint, particularly during overhead movements.

### Infraspinatus Muscle

**Origin**: Arising from the infraspinous fossa of the scapula.

**Insertion**: It inserts onto the greater tubercle of the humerus, just below the supraspinatus.

**Action**: The infraspinatus facilitates external rotation of the shoulder joint and helps stabilize the humeral head within the glenoid cavity during arm movements.

### Teres Minor Muscle

**Origin**: Originating from the lateral border of the scapula.

**Insertion**: It inserts onto the greater tubercle of the humerus, inferior to the infraspinatus.

**Action**: The teres minor aids in external rotation of the shoulder joint and provides additional stability during arm movements, particularly when the arm is raised or rotated outwards.,

### Subscapularis Muscle

**Origin**: Arising from the subscapular fossa of the scapula.

**Insertion**: It inserts onto the lesser tubercle of the humerus.

**Action**: The subscapularis muscle facilitates internal rotation of the shoulder joint and contributes to the stabilization of the humeral head within the glenoid cavity.
