Secret Handshake Club I do offer a **monthly membership discount program** I call the **Secret Handshake Club**: it’s a recurring membership that provides three main benefits: “Free” massage One free benefit massage per billing period. You use it before the next billing period starts. Discounted Massages A 20% discount on all other massage services (except the couples massage workshop)

## Benefits of regular massage

- Ongoing lessened Pain and Stress

- Improvedmood

- Better Range of Motion

- Boosted immune function

- And that **GREAT FEELING** that comes from knowing you’re taking ongoing steps to manage and improve your overall pain level and health!

I do offer the Secret Handshake Club at two price points:  

- Silver, which includes one benefit 60 minute massage treatment per billing period, and furring treatments discounted 20% for $96/month

- Gold, includes one benefit 90 minute massage session per billing period, plus the discount, for $144/month.

As you can see, it’s a great deal for ongoing self care.

There are a few caveats:

- The benefit massage must be used during its billing period; it does not rollover.

- It’s only for services, not gift cards

- Non-transferable 

- I require a 6 month commitment, then it goes month to month and can be cancelled at any point after the commitment period ends. 

If you would like to set up this commitment to your improved wellness, you can reply and let me know, and then I’ll call to take your payment information.
