I have a real passion for helping people live better, more pain-free lives through massage therapy and bodywork.

For 20 years, Paul was a computer programmer, sitting long hours at a desk staring at a monitor, so he can relate to  the stresses of long hours at a desk. 

Since 2003, he's been a Certified Massage Therapist, helping others with their pain, stress, through pregnancy, and helped with athletes from the weekend warrior to olympic athletes and pro baseball and football players.

"My philosophy is that service to others is the highest form of living."

You don't have to hurt - massage can help!
