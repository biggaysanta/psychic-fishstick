### \[icon name="water" prefix="fas"\] Tidal Wave Relaxation Massage -

> I guarantee you have never had an experience like this.

> \-Me

The Tidal Wave is an Esalen-inspired Swedish Massage. It incorporates long flowing strokes, kneading, and percussion. It also includes vibration and friction strokes. These techniques achieve a deep state of relaxation in your body. A tidal wave relaxation massage combines full body-length effleurage (open-handed stroke) in a very rhythmic manner. It also uses regional work to lull you into a state of deep relaxation. Due to the nature of this innovative relaxation massage work, I have developed a custom draping technique. This technique ensures client modesty. It also allows me to perform this Sacramento relaxation massage effectively and achieve great results. You can feel better.


### \[icon name="ranking-star" prefix="fas"\] Sports Massage

A Sacramento sports massage will help you maintain tip-top shape for your particular athletic endeavor! This type of massage is generally both faster paced and deeper than relaxation massage. It includes joint mobilization, trigger point therapy, and various compression and stretching techniques. Over the past twenty+ years, I’ve helped Olympic volleyball players, professional baseball pitchers, and professional running backs. I've also worked with elite marathon runners, triathletes, ultra distance cyclists, and more to help them reach their performance goals. You don’t need to be a pro athlete to benefit from a Sacramento sports massage. You just need the desire for self care. With your desire and my skill and passion for excellence, you’ll get the results you’re looking for.


### \[icon name="person-pregnant" prefix="fas"\] Prenatal Massage

Pregnant people have special needs for massage, especially as gestation progresses. Prenatal massage considers several factors. As the pregnancy progresses, positioning on the table changes. Additionally, areas of focus and pressure needs change. NOTE: high-risk pregnancies require written clearance from your medical team before services will be rendered.

> I've gone to Paul for a couple years now and he is amazing! Now that I am pregnant, I schedule appointments every few weeks and he has really helped alleviate some of my back pain. He is also easy to talk to about exactly what is bothering me and my comfort has always been his priority.
