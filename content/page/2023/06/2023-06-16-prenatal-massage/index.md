Prenatal Massage is right for You!

## \[icon name="hand-point-up" prefix="fas"\] Prenatal Massage Is for You!

Pregnant people have very special needs when it comes to massage:

## \[icon name="gem" prefix="fas"\] Pressure Changes

As gestation progresses, you preference for the amount of pressure applied during a massage will likely become more sensitive. What might have felt like hurts-so-good pressure before might become intolerable during your pregnancy. This can become a light touch near your delivery date. But your mileage may vary; some people maintain their pressure preferences throughout pregnancy. We will work together to ensure your comfort safety at all times.

## \[icon name="recycle" prefix="fas"\] Positioning

During a prenatal massage, how you lay upon the table will change as you progress: you’ll transition from normal face down and up during the first trimester, to sidelying in the second and third trimesters, and possibly even seated near the end of your pregnancy. These positions are for your maximum comfort and safety during a prenatal massage. We will use extra pillows and support to keep you comfy.

## \[icon name="magnifying-glass" prefix="fas"\] Areas of Focus

Each pregnancy is different, but there are some commonalities about areas pregnant people like to have massaged. We will collaborate on these areas we go along.

You’ll going to feel so much better when you can be in a safe comfortable space in which to relax and just be you without the social niceties that go along with being pregnant. Once you are on the table, we can be totally silent or speak as much as you wish; I take my lead from you.
