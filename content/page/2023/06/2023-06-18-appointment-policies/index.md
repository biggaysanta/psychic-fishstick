I value **communication over non-communication**, and am willing to be flexible with clients once they have an established relationship with me. But in general, these are my appointment policies:

## \[icon name="2" prefix="fas"\]\[icon name="4" prefix="fas"\] Cancellation Policy

If you must cancel this appointment, you have 24 hours before the start time of the appointment to cancel without paying a cancellation fee. If you cancel the appointment less than 24 hours, you will be responsible for the entire session fee.

## \[icon name="fish-fins" prefix="fas"\] No Show Policy

If you do not show up for your appointment and do not communicate with me, by the 15 minute late mark, I will consider you a no-show, and you will pay the entire session fee from the card I have on file for you.

## \[icon name="calendar-day" prefix="fas"\] Rescheduling Policy

The only exception to the cancellation policy is if you call to reschedule before the . I am willing to be flexible with clients, but habitual rescheduling will be treated like cancellations.

## \[icon name="user-clock" prefix="fas"\] Late Policy

Sessions start on time, and end on time. If I am late, the session will be extended by the amount of my lateness, or if not possible to extend, the late time will be added on to the next session.

## \[icon name="handshake-simple" prefix="fas"\] Secret Handshake Club Members

If you are a member of the Secret Handshake Club, these policies also apply to you. I will bill you at the discounted rate if you are a no-show. You will not lose your member benefit massage, and may still redeem it as long as the billing period has not closed.
