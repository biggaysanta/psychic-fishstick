## \[icon name="person-circle-question" prefix="fas"\] You’ve booked your first massage, now what?

You’ve been looking forward to your session for a while, and the [day is finally here](https://paulbrown.noterro.com), but what do you do? Let’s talk about it! Here are some useful tips to help you prep for your [massage:](https://paulbrown.net/the-two-hour-massage-returns/)

## \[icon name="ban" prefix="fas"\] Sobriety: no alcohol, marijuana, or other intoxicants

You might think that being a little buzzed would be a good thing to help you relax for the session, but think about this: [your massage therapist](https://paulbrown.net/meet-paul-brown-cmt/) wants honest, accurate, cogent feedback in order to provide you with the most comfortable and safe experience possible, and alcohol, cannabis, and stimulants alter your perception of touch, making accurate feedback impossible. Plus, alcohol exits through your skin, mildly dehydrates, and the odor is unpleasant. So arrive unimpaired as part of your [massage](https://paulbrown.net/services/) prep regimen.

Prescription medication are, of course, fine. But let your massage therapist know what they are so they can make adjustments to ensure safety. Blood thinners contraindicate certain types of deep tissue massage, for example.

## \[icon name="shower" prefix="fas"\] Nice, Long Warm Shower

Two reasons for this massage prep step:

- Hygiene - clean skin is easier to work with, and is not malodorous

- And it starts the relaxation process, gets your mind more centered and body a little warm.

Of course, not everyone has this option; you might be coming from work or some other outing, but if possible, be [freshly showered](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/shower-how-often#). This massage prep step will make you feel fresh and ready to receive the work.

## \[icon name="utensils" prefix="fas"\] Not Too Full, Not Too Hungry

Being too hungry is a distraction, you might also get a mild headache from it; and too full will be rather uncomfortable during some prone position work, and might trigger reflux in those who experience that in supine work. Massage Prep tip: a [light snack](https://paulbrown.net/the-apple-test/) to stave off hunger is just fine, though.

## \[icon name="bullseye" prefix="fas"\] Reasons and Goals

This bit of massage prep will help you clarify your thoughts. Why did you book the session? Is it for relaxation, or maybe you have a [pain issue](https://paulbrown.net/what-is-myofascial-therapy/) you’d like addressed, having trouble [sleeping](https://paulbrown.net/scalp-massage-yes/), or something else? How would you like to feel afterwards? Bring those thoughts forward so you are ready to discuss them with your massage therapist.  

## \[icon name="battery-quarter" prefix="fas"\] Most of All, Prepare to Have Some You Time

Remember, you deserve to treat yourself well; you are worth this time to focus on your well-being, to recharge, to heal. Doing a little massage prep is the start of the You time. **You don’t have to hurt**, I’m here to help.
