SPORTS MASSAGE

Perform better, Recover _faster_,  
Feel _great_

Sports Massage combines [Swedish Massage](https://paulbrown.net/what-is-swedish-massage/), [Trigger Point Therapy](https://paulbrown.net/neck-and-low-back-pain-try-massage-study/), [Myofascial Release](https://paulbrown.net/what-is-myofascial-therapy/), and Joint Mobilization to help you achieve your athletic goals.

It’s faster paced than both relaxation and medical massage, but it is wonderfully effective at decreasing recovery times and helping prevent injury.

Throughout my career,I have worked with Olympic-level and professional athletes, and ordinary weekend warriors. **I am here to help.**
