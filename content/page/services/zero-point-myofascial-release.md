## Zero Point Myofascial Release

### Pain really sucks, right?

 And yet it is one of the universal human experiences. From headaches to sprains and strains, frozen shoulder to plantar fasciitis, carpal tunnel syndrome to low back pain, body pain can drag us down, making it hard to do our every day life tasks, contributing to depression and anxiety, and just feels yucky. And about two-thirds of body pain is myofascial in nature: the muscles and connective tissues.  

 ### You Don't Have to Hurt

 fortunately, there are answers to the problem of body pain., And my exclusive and innovative zero point myofascial therapy is one of those!

 ### What is the Zero Point?

 imagine for a moment moving your elbow. In order to bend your elbow, or flex it, you contract your bicep muscles in the upper arm which pull the bones of the upper arm and the forearm closer together, flexing the elbow. Now imagine the opposite, extending the elbow. You contract the tricep muscles in the upper arm which pull the bones of the arm farther apart, extending the elbow.

 in both of those movements, you are either contracting muscles that are performing the action or eccentrically contracting the muscles that are the opposite of the action. In these cases, the muscles doing eccentric contraction are the triceps, and the biceps respectively. 

 So with this in mind, the zero point, also called the liminal point, is the area that resides between contraction and eccentric contraction. it is the place where no electrochemical signals are being sent into the muscle fibers. and that is where I do my work.

 ### How Does it Work?

 Zero point myofascial relief works because it is using the bodies natural processes to induce a release. Our tissues can unwind, adhesions can be undone, and a sense of relief and elimination of pain are possible because of this style of work.

 The work is pain-free yet deep, highly anatomically specific yet cascades throughout the entire body. The wings of the butterfly can be the hurricane on the other side of the world. when tension is released in one part of the body, the system must retention itself in order to create balance and homeostasis, that retention comes at a reduction in the overall amount of tension, and thehen tension is released in one part of the body, the system must retention itself in order to create balance and homeostasis, that retention comes at a reduction in the overall amount of tension, and the sense of more freedom of movement and less pain. And we all want less pain, right?
