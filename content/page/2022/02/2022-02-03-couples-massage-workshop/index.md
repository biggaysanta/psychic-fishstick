## Private Two-hour Couples Massage Workshop

When you are looking for that perfect experience for you and your special someone, a Paul Brown Massage Therapy Couples Massage Workshop is just the right thing!

## What is a Couples Massage Workshop?

A Couples Massage Workshop is a private two-hour class for you and one other person. You’ll learn a little bit about massage, and then you’ll learn how to stand, move, hold your hands, and learn a couple of massage strokes up the back of the body: legs, hips, back and shoulders.

Each participant receives about 45 minutes of individual instruction, and will learn Swedish Massage techniques that can be applied up the back of the body, but adapted to the front of the body as well. It’s a great way to bond with your special someone!
