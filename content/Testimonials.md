# Testimonials

> My first visit with Paul was very eye-opening. He [relieved a lot of my pain](https://paulbrown.net/what-is-myofascial-therapy/) by going deep into muscles that I didn't know I had. I'm still walking better two weeks later and my lower back is much better. I can highly recommend Paul to , you.  
> I was amazed at the intake form that was on his website, it was very thorough. When I arrived at my first appointment he had studied it and already an idea of what he wanted to accomplish for me. Next month I will be signing up for the [monthly program](https://paulbrown.net/secret-handshake-club/). The very best body work I have ever had. Thanks Paul
