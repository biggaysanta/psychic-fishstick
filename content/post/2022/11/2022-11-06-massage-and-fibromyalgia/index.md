Fibromyalgia syndrome, or fibro, is one of the most common, most difficult, most complex, and least understood health-related conditions ever seen.

Learn more in Ruth Werner's new article, "[Working With Invisible Pain—The Sustainable Practices MTs Can Use to Help Clients with Fibromyalgia,](http://www.massageandbodyworkdigital.com/i/1481961-november-december-2022/38?)" in the November/December issue of Massage & Bodywork magazine.

Key Points:  
• Fibromyalgia pain—invisible, private, and completely reliable— becomes, in a fully human but dysfunctional way, a defining feature of that individual’s personality.  
• No two people with fibro can be treated the same way, but they all want to feel safe, reduce their stress, and be respected.  
• Clients with fibro deserve our appreciation and respect, even though they might present some special challenges for bodywork practitioners.
