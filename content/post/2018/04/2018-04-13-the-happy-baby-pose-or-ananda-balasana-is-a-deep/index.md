The Happy Baby pose, or Ananda Balasana, is a deep hip opening for the adductors and also the back along the spine. It is an easy pose to get into and hold, and I recommend it as a very relaxing and comfortable posture.

## How do you do the Happy Baby?

Happy Baby is a pose that starts in the supine position.  

- Lay comfortably on your back
- Bring your knees up toward your chest
- Bring your arms between your legs, and gently grab your same-side big toe.
- Let the weight of your arms create openness in your hips;  each time you exhale, feel your hips relax and your spine unwind
- Giggle and coo like a happy baby! [optional]

## What does Happy Baby Do?

When we assume the Happy Baby pose, we get down into a supine position, on you back.  As you are placing your sacrum onto the floor, try to let your lower spine flatten to the floor as well; this creates a neutral position and helps to start lengthen the spine.

Bringing your knees up toward your chest opens the posterior hips, and assists in relaxing the spine.  Also, as you bring your knees to either side of you body, your hip adductor muscles open, and unwind, relaxing.  That relaxing, takes pressure off of your pelvis: ischium and pubis, specifically, which creates another tension release.
Grabbing your toes creates an even deeper stretch, assisting every other action by deepening and holding the stretches on the hips, adductors, and spine.
As you exhale, the back of your body relaxes, and by bringing your awareness into the back of your body, especially the lower spine, you can create even more unwinding and relaxation.

Plus, who doesn't want to feel like a happy baby?

## Benefits of Happy Baby Pose

There are numerous benefits to including Happy Baby into your stretching routines.  

1. The hips are the very center of gravity of your body. Relaxing them has a cascading effect leading to every other part of the body - literally everything in the body is connected via fascia to the hips.  There are direct fascial links.  

***The toe bone connected to the foot bone, indeed.***
