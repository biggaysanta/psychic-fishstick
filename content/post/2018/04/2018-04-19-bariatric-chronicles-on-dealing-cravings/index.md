> Something I do when I’m craving something is I sit with the feeling. I acknowledge that it’s there, and seek to understand it, knowing that it will pass.
> 
> What am I noticing in my body? What feelings are manifesting, and how? Am I lonely, angry, bored, horny, tired, frustrated, what have you?
> 
> Understanding and recognizing those feelings and patterns of feeling in the body is very important to mastering yourself and staying on the path of health and fitness.
> 
> You’ve got this!
