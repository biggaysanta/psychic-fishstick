I was doing some data analysis this morning of which days of the week are the most popular for my clients.  I should note that I do not work on Sundays and Mondays, but have done a few appointments here and there on an ad hoc basis, so I’m not really counting them.   

It’s fascinating what you can learn when you analyize your data!
