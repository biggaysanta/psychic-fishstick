## The Wizard of Pain - the Mighty Infraspinatus  

“it feels like a deep ache in my shoulder joint.”

If you are an anatomy nerd like me, hearing a client say that is both empathetic and exciting.  Empathy, because I’ve had that particular shoulder pain before, and exciting, because it’s very often caused by easily accessible trigger points in the back of the shoulder.  Let’s begin:

The infraspinatus muscle (IS) is one of the four **rotator cuff** muscles, along with the _supraspinatis, subscapularis,_ and _teres minor_.

The IS is a thick short muscle that externally rotates the ball and socket of the shoulder joint.  It also helps to stabilize the shoulder socket when our shoulder is flexed – that is, our arms are extend out in front of our body – like when we are typing on a keyboard or looking at our smartphones, or playing the piano, or any other number of tasks we do in our daily activities.

It’s easy for this muscle to become overworked or overloaded, which leads to _myofascial trigger points_, or just trigger points for short.  Trigger points are characterized by being **“exquisitely tender”** hard nodule in a muscle or tendon.  When you touch it, it hurts, and often you’ll feel pain in a distant area as well.  In the case of the IS muscle,  referred pain can feel like a _**deep ache in the shoulder joint**_, front of the shoulder, sometimes all the way down to the pinky fingers.

## Treatment

**Massage** is one of the most effective methods of treating Infraspinatus Trigger Points. A trained massage therapist can locate, treat, and eliminate them quickly and easily, and the satellite trigger points that can sometimes develop in the anterior deltoid and other places.  

Get a tennis ball and put it all the way deep in a sock.  Tie a knot in the sock tight up against the tennis ball.  Now you have a self-massage tool you can use to massage Infraspinatus Trigger Points.   Find a tender point in the lower part of the shoulder blade, use the ball to apply pressure to it while leaning into the ball against a wall.  Press and hold for 60-90 seconds, or until you feel the tender point diminish in tenderness.    You’ll feel relief in the deep shoulder pain almost immediately.
