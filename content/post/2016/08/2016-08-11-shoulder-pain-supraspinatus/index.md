Shoulder Pain, Part 2: The Tricksy Supraspinatus

Did you know that the most commonly injured rotator cuff muscle is the small but mighty _supraspinatus_? It’s true.  Because of how the muscle is located on the body and in relationship to the acromial clavicular joint and the humerus, it’s often caught in a scissor-like pincing and can be torn pretty easily.

Also, the supraspinatus can be the source of referred pain in the shoulder and elbow, sometimes masking as lateral epicondylitis, or tennis elbow.  But as we will see, the tricksy supraspinatus is a naughty culprit.

## Signs and Symptoms

Pain in the front of the shoulder, the lateral epicondyle are both signs that the supraspinatus muscle may be involved.  Also, if you have difficulty with tasks that involve holding the arms up, like riding a bike, folding laundry, raking, or other activities, the supraspinatus could be involved.  Finally, if you hold your smartphone with the hand of your affected arm, like playing pokemon go, for instance, or lots of texting, the supraspinatus would be implicated.  As you can see, this a muscle that gets involved with a lot of actions!

## Anatomy

As you can see in the diagram, the supraspinatus originates in the medial side of the supraspinus fossa, the “basin” at the top of the scapula, directly superior to the spine of the scapula.  From there, it moves laterally, diving under the spine and clavicle at the AC joint, where it attaches onto the greater tubercle of the humerus bone.  It’s action is the abduct the ball and socket joint of the shoulder.  Also, it helps stabilize the shoulder joint.  So you can see that the supraspinatus does a lot.

## Referred Pain Patterns

You can see the referred pain patterns in red, and the corresponding trigger points.  The first illustration, the most lateral trigger point causes a deep aching tenderness right at the point of the trigger point.  In the second, the trigger points in the muscle belly can also cause the shoulder joint pain, but also the pain in the lateral epicondyle, which is where the muscles of the back of the forearm (posterior compartment) attach onto the outside of the upper arm, just above the elbow.  It can also have radiating pain from shoulder toward elbow, or elbow toward wrist.

## Treatment

The best treatment for supraspinatus trigger points is deep focused trigger point massage by a qualified massage therapist, physical therapist, chiropractor, osteopath or physician.  There are some self treatments, but it can be difficult to access the muscle due to it’s inconvenient location.  But if you have a self-care tool like a theracane or back knobber, you can get pinpoint pressure right where it’s needed.

Of course, a therapeutic bodyworker is also going to know the other muscles that could potentially be involved with shoulder or elbow pain, so if you can, book an appointment to get the thorough care you deserve!
