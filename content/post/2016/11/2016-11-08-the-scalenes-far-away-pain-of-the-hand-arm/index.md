Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is one of the most misdiagnosed pain conditions.  Why, you ask?  Because of three tiny muscles in the neck called the scalenes, or more specifically, the anterior, middle, and posterior scalene muscles.  Myofascial Trigger Points (tender spots) in the scalene muscles can mimic several other pain conditions, and yet they are relatively easy to treat and control.

How do the scalenes do it?  It’s pretty simple - the nerves that power the arm pass between the scalenes as the nerves pass from the spine, under the collarbone, and out to the arm.  Tight or dysfunctional scalene muscles, especially the Anterior and Middle Scalenes, can cause pain, numbness, or weakness.  See the red areas of the illustration above?  The more red, the greater likeliness of referred pain in that area.  It can feel burning, or a constant ache, numbness and tingling, or sometimes stabbing pain.

The scalene muscles aren’t the only culprit in these pain areas, but they are one of the most important to check, especially when dealing with people who spend much of their day sitting at a desk or computer.

Massage therapy is an excellent treatment for scalene trigger points, as they can be difficult to access on one’s own and be able to apply the proper amount of force to make a trigger point deactivate.  There are also some good stretches you can do - here’s a video I made back in 2014 that shows exactly how to do them.
