> ## What is a Couples Massage Workshop?
> 
> A [**Couples Massage Workshop**](http://paulbrownmassagetherapy.fullslate.com/go/1624/Couples-Massage-Workshop) is a two-hour session of instruction and mutual massage for a couple - you’ll learn several important techniques for giving a safe, effective massage to your spouse or friend or sibling or parent or whomever, including body mechanics for the massaging partner (all important for keeping your hands pain-free), and the various strokes of Swedish Massage.  It’s a great way to build non-sexual intimacy with your partner, and take care of each other!
