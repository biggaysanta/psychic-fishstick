An area of practice Iâ€™ve been in for about a year now is providing massage and bodywork services to our military veterans. As a veteran myself (USN 1988 to 1993), I understand many of the unique stressors and conditions that our military veterans have experienced during their time of service.

Many of our servicemembers and veterans carry injuries and emotional trauma unique to their situations. My work has evolved a deeply sensitive approach to their bodies and needs, and this area of practice is some of the most rewarding I do. Helping our military members and veterans feel less pain and stress from their time of service is profoundly humbling and gratifying.

Especially important is helping servicemembers to observe their bodies even during times when they might be remembering trauma during bodywork. Coaching breathwork, reassuring them of their safety and encouraging them to observe their thoughts and feelings during bodywork without losing contact with the present moment. Its like being a meditation coach and massage therapist simultaneously.

In the end, as work progresses, seeing our warriors lay down their armor and be themselves, watching deeply held and guarded patterns of tension melt away, and the trust develop to allow for deeper levels of work and easier daily activities of living makes this work fulfilling and helps spread peace in the world.

I love my work so much!
