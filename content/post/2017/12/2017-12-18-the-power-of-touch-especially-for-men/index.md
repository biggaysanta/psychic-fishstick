[The Power of Touch, Especially for Men](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/well/family/gender-men-touch.html)

From The NY Times article:

Touch is the first, and perhaps most profound, language we learn when we’re very young, says Tiffany Field, director of the Touch Research Institute at the University of Miami School of Medicine. Touch might have a more immediate impact than words, Dr. Field said in an email, “because it is physical and leads to a chain of bioelectric and chemical changes that basically relax the nervous system.”

> The more platonic touch we have in the world, the more peace we’d have. More bonobo, less chimpanzee.
