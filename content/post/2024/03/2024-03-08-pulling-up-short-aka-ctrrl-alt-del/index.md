So back on 17 January 2024, I was walking along a sidewalk and I was struck by an F-150 pickup truck. I was briefly knocked unconscious and blah, blah, blah, sustained some injuries and damage to my electronics. Whatever right?

Well, not really. Although I survived, and I will get the necessary care I need to heal as much as I can, the experience compelled to do some frank and cogent examination of the state of affairs of my bodywork practice, and more importantly, my attitude toward "tending the garden," as it were.

Since the pandemic began, the shutdown of all those businesses, and self-centeredly, my particular business, really put me in a holding pattern, a sense of uncertainty, a funky cold medina. My practice, one of the most important things in my life, languished, a malaise of depression and anxiety swept over me, and I struggled to maintain my wholeness as a practitioner of bodywork. Dark days, indeed.

But it's funny what an inflection point like getting hit by a truck will do to circling back around to our conceit of the show, to make you examine what is, and what you like to be. It sounds like an overwrought cliche: near death experience, man reevaluates his life choices. Odd, but true, and feels very much like how they portray it in the talkies, er, um, movies and tv. An important opportunity to think and make decisions.

And decisions translate in to action:

- I'm reinvesting in equipment and supplies and consumables and reviving previously used services and developing new ones
  - Using select essential oils to make harmonious blends for use in my practice, and making the blends available for purchase.

- Doing more marketing and advertising to increase interest and client acquisition, being judicious and with specific goals to meet for increasing my numbers.

- I'm about to paint my office to align my aesthetic and therapeutic goals.

- Invested in a new grow light for my beloved but kinda ragged African Violets, so I can mimic the brightness and natural amount of light they receive.

- Focusing to keep the office part of my space more visually appealing.

- And continuing to improve and stay consistent with my mental health regimen to keep being as present as I can be for you, my delightful clients.

All these things are happening or in the pipeline, because I am a dedicating myself to not just maintaining but growing my client base. **_I am making these important improvements in my service TO YOU_**, precisely because my core value and my actions will realign and make my work feel like play and flow forth toward you to help you.

Thanks for reading,

Paul
