## Does massage boost the immune system?

We all know that massage feels great, but what is it actually doing to you when you receive it, and how long do the effects last?

## Massage Immunity Boost Experiment

In a [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22775448/) in the Journal of Complementary and Alternative Therapies, published by the National Institutes of Health, researchers at [Emory University School of Medicine](http://www.psychiatry.emory.edu/) and [Cedar-Sinai Hospital](https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/research/areas/biostatistics-bioinformatics.html) in Los Angeles set out to measure stress response and immune response in a controlled study of Swedish Massage vs a protocol of light touch.

## what was the experiment?

In the study, three groups of participants received either a weekly or twice-weekly [Swedish Massage](https://paulbrown.net/what-is-swedish-massage/), or light touch with the backs of the hands.  Massage therapists performed either massage or light touch following the same protocol: in the prone position shoulders down to feet, then in the supine position, from feet to shoulders over the course of 45 minutes.

## How Did the massage immunity Study Do?

**From the study:**

_Compared to the touch control condition, weekly Swedish massage stimulated a sustained pattern of increased circulating phenotypic lymphocyte markers and decreased mitogen-stimulated cytokine production, similar to previously reported studies for a single massage session, with minimal effect on hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal function. Twice-weekly massage produced a different response pattern with increased OT levels, decreased AVP, and decreased CORT but little effect on circulating lymphocyte phenotypic markers and a slight increase in mitogen-stimulated interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-2 levels, suggesting increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines._

## Conclusion: did massage boost immunity?

The conclusion of the study is that there are profound and sustained biological changes that result from massage which suggest decreased stress and improved immune function.  The challenge of this study, which the authors note, is that the small study size can tend to over inflate the results; they used only physically and mentally healthy individuals, which could limit the effects of the study.  

## What's next for massage immunity research?

The massage industry desperately needs more good quality research in the field of massage therapy.

## Boost your immune system with regular massage

Still, the results of the study to tend to confirm other similar studies in the field, and can recommend massage as a healthy part of one's self-care.
