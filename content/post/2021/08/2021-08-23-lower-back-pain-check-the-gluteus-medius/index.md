Lower back pain: millions of people experience it every single day, and there are many potential causes, but one that is sometimes overlooked is the _[gluteus medius muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluteus_medius)_, a broad swath of muscle on the lateral aspect of the hip.

#### What does the **gluteus** medius do?

The gluteus medius muscle is the most important muscle for _hip abduction_ (opening the hip to the side), and less important in flexion, medial rotation, and lateral rotation.  It is similar in function to the deltoid in the shoulder.

#### Signs of gluteus medius pain

A person might experience pain in the upper buttock and lower back when walking, laying on one's back or affected side, or when slouching in a chair.  "Lumbago," as it used to be called, but now referred to as Lower Back Pain, is some of the most debilitating myofascial pains that we have, and can effect one's mental health, especially in men, where depression is often an underlying cause of low back pain.  LBP causes a drag on the US Economy, in the millions of dollars.

#### Gluteus Medius Massage

Massage can release tight gluteus medius muscles, with especially tight spots responding well to both ischemic compression and deep transverse friction.  [Get a massage!](https://noterro.com/calendars/bookOnlineStepOne/338d9ed6026f869f67d76258ca704ea9)

#### Take Care of your Gluteus Medius…

##### and your Gluteus Medius Will Take Care of You!

So, you can see that there are many ways you can do stretch the gluteus medius muscle.  But another effective method is my personal favorite: get a massage!  When a muscle has been loosened up from the mechanical action of professionally applied therapeutic massage, it will be much more able to stretch and be pain-free!
