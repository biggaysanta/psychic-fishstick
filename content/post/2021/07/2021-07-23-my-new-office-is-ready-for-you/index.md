My new room!

When I got the email from the building owner saying they were opening up the west wing of the third-floor to existing tenants, I was very excited. The entire west wing had been empty for many years after they tried and failed several times to find a large tenant to move into it. Because of that failure, they decided to open the individual offices up as suites for existing tenants, and then new tenants to lease.

I saw Suite 325 and immediately fell in love with it: the 11 foot ceilings, the large bay window that looks over the former Saint Rose of Lima Park, now Ali Youssefi Plaza, the wonderful natural light, green tree canopy, and all that delightful floor space combined to seduce me away from my cramped, low-ceiling office I’d been in for a few years.   

I knew that I wanted to paint the walls a soft relaxing color, and I sought permission from the building owner, and they agreed that I could choose this beautiful rose pink color that I have chosen. Pink is a profoundly powerful and relaxing color, and as soon as you walk into the space it just loosens the tension in your shoulders right away. It’s very easy to breathe in this room, and I find myself staying in the room sometimes for hours after my last client is gone for the day just because I enjoy the space so much!  

I feel fortunate to have been able to move into this beautiful room, and want to share this relaxing space with all of my clients and potential clients.  I know once you experience the room, you’ll enjoy it too!
