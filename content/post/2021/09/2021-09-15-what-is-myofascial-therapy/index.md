When Swedish Massage isn't specific enough, there are other options for getting into tissues.  One of them _Myofascial Therapy_.  myo- = muscle, and fascia = connective tissue.  MFT, as it's also called, is comprised of two main strokes: _longitudinal release_ and _deep transverse friction, or cross-fiber friction_.  These two powerful strokes can be very useful tools in a massage therapist's arsenal of strokes to effect change in soft tissues, reducing pain, and increasing range of motion for clients.

#### Setting

Typically, MFT is performed on a [massage table](https://paulbrown.net/about-me/advanced-massage-table/)  that has been lowered more than it would normally be for a Swedish Massage.  This is to ensure that the MT's legs and hips can really provide more power to the hands.  I'll cover body mechanics for massage therapists in another post.  

#### Warm-up

Before performing the MFT strokes, it is necessary to warm up the tissues to be worked.  This can be done with a couple of strokes: friction circles, tissue compression, or the dreaded skin rolling.  I'm just joking about it being dreaded; some people actually enjoy it! (I'm not one of those people.)  But after several minutes of warm-up strokes, the main action can take place.

#### Longitudinal Release

As its name suggests, longitudinal release works _with_ the direction of the muscle fibers, that is to say, lengthwise, or parallel to the muscle fibers.  Hands are vaulted and stacked for stability and support, and a "slack-sink-stroke" technique is employed.  Strokes are short but powerful, pressure should be at the perfect amount for client comfort.  LR will bring about a lengthening of the affected muscle to help improve range of motion.

#### Cross Fiber Friction

The purpose of cross fiber friction is to reduce pain and adhesions through two strokes: slack-sink-stroke and sawing.  These strokes are performed with increased pressure, but still at the client's comfort level, perpendicular to the direction of muscle fibers.

##### Summary

Using LR and CFF, a [well-trained](https://paulbrown.net/about-me/) massage therapist can effect great change to a client in a short amount of time.
