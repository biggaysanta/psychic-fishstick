A recent [metastudy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23126534/) looking at studies Complimentary and Alternative Medicine in the treatment of non-specific low back or neck pain showed that massage was effective in reducing pain and disability in low back pain, and reducing pain and disability in neck pain. Massage was significantly superior to physiotherapy for low back pain reduction.

The only downside was the cost of treatment compared to primary care treatment (physician), which reported slightly higher costs associated with massage treatment. This runs toward massage not generally being accepted by insurance companies, although that is slowly changing as more research is conducted.

We need more quality studies on the effects of massage therapy on body pain.

If you are suffering from low back or neck pain, massage therapy can be a significant helpful part of your treatment regimen!
