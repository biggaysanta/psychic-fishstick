# Self-Myofascial Release: Helpful or a Waste of Time?

The data seems to indicated “Meh” on Self-Myofascial Release.

You hear the term “self-myofascial release” a lot these days, but what is it and what does it do? Let’s talk about it.

## Self-myofascial Release Defined

Self-myofascial release, or SMR, are the collection of techniques that involve the use of a firm density foam roller or massage roller device to purportedly effect change in the tension of the [fascia](https://paulbrown.net/myofascial-release/), the body wide system o-f connective tissues that hold the body together.

So SMR is another way of saying foam rolling, but what does it purport to do?

Proponents of SMR tout many benefits: decreased pain, improved flexibility, among other benefits. But what does the data say?

According to a 2019 [meta-analysis of research on self-myofascial release](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2019.00376/full), SMR was found to be only negligibly effective on strength and flexibility during foam rolling prior to exercise, offering very short term increases in flexibility and jump. Post-rolling slightly decreased the severity of DOMS, or delayed onset muscle soreness, but had small effect on strength and flexibility.

## What Works?

[Myofascial Release Therapy](https://paulbrown.net/myofascial-release/) as performed by a trained and experienced massage therapist is an effective, comfortable and safe bodywork therapy that can demonstrate positive results for many pain conditions, including for pre- and post-exercise events.
