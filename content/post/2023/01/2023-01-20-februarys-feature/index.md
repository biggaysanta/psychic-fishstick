With Valentines Day coming up, you might be looking for the perfect gift for your loved one; well, do I have the perfect one for you!

A Couple’s Massage Workshop is a great experience: a private, two-hour class where you and your loved one will learn the basics of giving each other a safe and effective Swedish Massage.

## “Don’t your hands hurt?”

People ask me this all the time, telling me that they can only massage for five minutes before their hands start hurting. Well, in your couple’s massage workshop, you’ll learn the correct way to move your body, hold your hands, and perform massage strokes so you can give each other a relaxing and healing massage.

In this class, you’ll each receive 45 minutes of individual instruction in giving a full back of the body massage: legs, hips, back, and shoulders. Then you’ll switch places and we will do it again.

You’ll both feel great and will have learned a fun skill! It’s a great way to bond with your partner…
