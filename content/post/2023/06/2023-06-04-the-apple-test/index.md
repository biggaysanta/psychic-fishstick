## The Apple Test? What’s That?

I’ve struggled with emotional, or comfort, eating for a long time, as long as I can remember. The coping mechanism might have been useful at some point in the past, but it helped me balloon up to 470 pounds, and eventually seek [out bariatric surgery](https://paulbrown.net/tag/bariatric-chronicles/) back in 2017, and lose 200 pounds. To help develop a healthier habit, I do what I call the Apple Test.

## How You Do It

Imagine you feel hungry, what do you do? Here’s what I do: I ask myself, would I eat an apple?

### Yes to the Apple Test?

If yes, I literally eat an apple! Then I iterate back: am I hungry? Would I eat an apple? And so on… So, I hear you asking, what do I do when I answer no? Good question!

### What to do if you Answer No

Ok, you now know you’re not feeling hungry, but how do you actually feel? Here’s where we rely upon NATT, or Notice, Acknowledge, Test, Take Action.

### Notice, Acknowledge, Test, Take Action

This is a mindfulness exercise that will help you identify what and why you are feeling what you are feeling.

First up, Notice: where in your body is the feeling manifesting? What emotion is it? Try to put a word to it, then

Acknowledge: accept that you are feeling whatever it is. maybe you’re feeling anxiety about something, maybe feeling a need to be social, whatever it is, acknowledge the fact and validity of your feeling. Let yourself feel it.

Test: take a moment to listen to what that feeling is telling you is happening. Is this something from the here and now? A remembrance of past emotion or trauma? A combination of things? Only you know the answer to this.

Take Action: what do you need to do about it? anxiety might mean do something right now, or it might mean you’re an old fear and I can let you pass me by. Feeling social might mean texting a friend, going out for a walk, grabbing a beer with a buddy, playing fetch with your dog, the possibilities are limitless.

## The Apple Test is Your Friend

All told, the apple test is a great way to bring mindfulness into your day. If quick and easy and effective. The apple test is useful to maintaining emotional equilibrium, and right decisions for you in that moment. It can feel terrific and worthwhile to incorporate into your mental health toolbox. It has definitely helped me!
