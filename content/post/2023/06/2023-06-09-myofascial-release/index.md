## In a nutshell: fascia holds us together. Myofascial Release Therapy can help you: **You Don't Have to Hurt**

[Myofascial Release Therapy](https://paulbrown.net/what-is-myofascial-therapy/) (MRT) is a type of massage that focuses on releasing tension in the fascia, the connective tissue that surrounds your muscles and organs. Myofascia is myo- = muscle, and fascia = connective tissue, specifically the connective tissue involving your muscles and tendons. MRT is a specific technique used in massage therapy to apply gentle pressure to the fascia to help it decrease tension and improve range of motion.

## \[icon name="info" prefix="fas"\] What is the fascia?

The fascia is a thin, elastic, web-like tissue that surrounds your muscles, organs, and bones. It is literally the glue that holds our body together. It forms our system of connective tissue, the tendons, ligaments, aponeurosises and fascial sheets. Without it, we would just be a blob of tissue on the ground with a bunch of bones sticking out! It also helps to transmit force throughout your body through its property of elasticity. As you can imagine, fascia is an important component of our bodies.

### Composition of Fascia

Fascia is made up of two main components:

- Collagen - this protein makes up the majority of material in fascia. It provides the basic structure of fascia. Collagen forms into thin sheets which surround and penetrate all other tissues in our bodies.

- hyaluronic acid, which acts as a lubricant between the sheets of fascia, and it resists compression. This fluid can become glue-like and cause the facial sheets to adhere to each other, limiting range of motion and increasing pain.

When the fascia becomes tight or restricted, it can cause pain and limit your range of motion.

MRT is a hands-on treatment that uses a variety of techniques to release tension in the fascia. These techniques can include:

- Longitudinal Release

- Deep Transverse Friction

- Passive and Active Stretching

- Trigger point therapy

- Client-active Pulse Therapy

- Joint Mobilization

- Sustained Cross-handed Holds

MRT can be used to treat a variety of conditions, including:

- [Back pain](https://paulbrown.net/back-pain-massage-myofascial-release/)

- [Neck pain](https://paulbrown.net/neck-and-low-back-pain-try-massage-study/)

- [Shoulder pain](https://paulbrown.net/the-shoulder/)

- [Headaches](https://paulbrown.net/scalp-massage-yes/)

- Temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ)

- [Carpal tunnel syndrome](https://paulbrown.net/the-scalenes-far-away-pain-of-the-hand-arm/)

- [Fibromyalgia](https://paulbrown.net/massage-and-fibromyalgia/)

- [Chronic pain](https://paulbrown.net/what-is-swedish-massage/)

- and More

#### Setting

Typically, MFT is performed on a [massage table](https://paulbrown.net/no-more-low-back-pain/)  that has been lowered more than it would normally be for a Swedish Massage.  This is to ensure that the MT's legs and hips can really provide more power to the hands.

## \[icon name="question" prefix="fas"\] How does Myofascial Release work

Myofascial release is a specific technique used in myofascial therapy to apply gentle pressure to the fascia to help it release tension. The therapist will use their hands to apply pressure to the fascia in a slow, sustained manner. This pressure helps to break up the adhesions and scar tissue that can cause the fascia to become tight.

#### Warm Up

Before performing the MFR strokes, it is necessary to warm up the tissues to be worked.  This can be done with a couple of strokes: friction circles, tissue compression, or the dreaded skin rolling.  I'm just joking about it being dreaded; some people actually enjoy it! (I'm not one of those people.)  But after several minutes of warm-up strokes, the main action can take place.

#### Sustained Holds

A typical example of this technique is the sustained hold. There are a few ways of doing this: trigger point therapy, where direct perpendicular pressure is applied to the tender nodules until the soften and release; cross-handed hold, the therapist places each hand at the insertion points of a muscle and applies oblique, sustained pressure, which encourages the fascia to “unwind;” and eccentric holds, allowing muscles that mostly perform eccentric contractions to release into their shortened, relaxed state.

#### Longitudinal Release

As its name suggests, longitudinal release (LR) works _with_ the direction of the muscle fibers, that is to say, lengthwise, or parallel to the muscle fibers.  Hands are vaulted and stacked for stability and support, and a "slack-sink-stroke" technique is employed.  Strokes are short but powerful, pressure should be at the perfect amount for client comfort.  LR will bring about a lengthening of the affected muscle to help improve range of motion.

#### Deep Transverse Friction

The purpose of deep transverse friction is to reduce pain and adhesions through two strokes: slack-sink-stroke and sawing.  These strokes are performed with increased pressure, but still at the client's comfort level, perpendicular to the direction of muscle fibers.

Myofascial release can be a very effective treatment for a variety of conditions. It is often used in conjunction with other treatments, such as physical therapy, to help improve range of motion and reduce pain.

## \[icon name="person-circle-exclamation" prefix="fas"\] Why choose me as your Myofascial Therapist?

You've come to the right place, as I've been a Myofascial Release Therapist since 2003. In fact, I’m a walking anatomy encyclopedia, in the best way. Given that, I use this knowledge to guide you through the process of MRT, by explaining what and why, and coaching your breath work. My unique approach to this style of massage is unmatched in this region and will achieve the results you seek. Come and see. You. Don't. Have. To. Hurt.

## \[icon name="hand-point-up" prefix="fas"\] What to expect during a myofascial therapy session

First things first: [follow these massage prep suggestions](https://paulbrown.net/how-to-massage-prep/) - they will make your session a much more comfortable, relaxing and productive experience.

A typical myofascial therapy session will last for 30-90 minutes. During the session, I will assess your pain and range of motion. I will then use a variety of techniques to release tension in the fascia. We will work together in a collaborative manner to achieve your goals. You may feel some discomfort during the session, but it should not be severe.

## \[icon name="bottle-water" prefix="fas"\] Aftercare

After a myofascial therapy session, you shouldn’t feel soreness. But if you do, gentle stretching and movement like a 20 minute walk will help. An over the counter pain reliever like [aspirin](https://www.drugs.com/aspirin.html), [acetaminophen](https://www.drugs.com/acetaminophen.html), [ibuprofen](https://www.drugs.com/ibuprofen.html), or [naproxen](https://www.drugs.com/naproxen.html) can help the next day, but is usually unnecessary.

Drink plenty of water, as this will help your body as it adjusts and rebalances itself to accommodate the changes in your body.

Make sure you get enough sleep, as this is the time your body needs to reset and repair.

### Is myofascial therapy safe?

Myofascial therapy is generally safe for most people. However, it is important to talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you have any health conditions, such as:

- [Bleeding disorders](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/bleeding-disorders)

- [Cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/what-is-cancer)

- [Infection](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/spread/index.html)
