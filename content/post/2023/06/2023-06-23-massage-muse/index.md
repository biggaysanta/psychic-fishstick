Does anyone else have a massage muse? A person of whom inspires you to want to develop ideas. I found my second muse today, and I'm feeling super excited to get back to the lab and brainstorm, allowing my pure massage creativity to blossom forth

I employ my muse to have extended sessions of staying in the flow, letting pure magination synthesize new information into tangible reality, acquired during the intervening time during my patient-client sessions. I probably read too much for my own good! But I digress.

That isn't to disparage intuition at all, on the contrary, I love using intuition during my work sessions, just a recognition that for me, I need these kind of brainstorming sessions to delve ideas and hypotheses without wasting time optimizing and refining the protocol on the fly on a paying client. Sometimes you have to try different means of developing your technique informed by the intuition.

What do you think of this? I'm interested in hearing others thoughts about this idea, and curious if anyone else does this, please - thank in advance!
