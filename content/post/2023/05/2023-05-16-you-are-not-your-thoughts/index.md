> What's one small improvement you can make in your life?

For me, I often get caught up in negative self-talk, and let myself become bogged down and distracted from the rest of the things I should be accomplishing.

When I catch myself doing that,I remind myself of this haiku I wrote in 2015:

```
Storm rages and shakesTornadoes and hurricanesCannot harm the sky
```

Remember that you are not your emotions nor your thoughts; they are but fleeting moments of your life.

I bid you peace.
