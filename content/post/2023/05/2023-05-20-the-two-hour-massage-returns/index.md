I have had a number of clients ask me for a return to that two hour session length, and I had held off on saying yes, but then I met The Mountain: a literal giant of a man; at 6’8” and 340 solid pounds, he makes me feel small, and I’m 6’5” and 285! Ninety minutes sessions simply weren’t long enough to meet his bodywork needs, so I figured what the heck, I can offer a limited number of longer sessions each week. Thus, the two hour massage returns!

The main benefit of a two hour massage is simply time: time enough to spend really paying attention to your entire body from back to front, top to bottom. Time seems to slow down when you have enough to thoroughly work through all your tense and tender areas. Your heart rate slows, breathing becomes more deep, free, and at ease. Stress melts away and you’ll feel renewed. A two hour massage can provide you with a truly complete sense of connectedness you yourself. **It’s all about you.**

The two hour massage length is only offered in my [Tidal Wave Relaxation Massage](https://paulbrown.net/services/#tidal) session.
