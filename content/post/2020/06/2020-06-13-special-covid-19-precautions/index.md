## New Guidelines for Sacramento County:

**The county has prohibited indoor massage, and only outdoor massage is permitted for the time being.  With that in mind, i have created a private outdoor space under the covered patio at my home in Colonial Manor.  My backyard is full of flowers and lush greenery, a fountain, birdsong, and fresh air.  It's a very luxurious experience!**

Starting June 19th, I'll be accepting appointments again with some precautions:

- Require clients to check their temperature before coming to appointment - any temperature of 100.4 or higher will mean we will reschedule your appointment, with no cancellation fee applied. 
- Clients must wear a facemask during the ENTIRE appointment, including the time on the table.  I will also be wearing a mask.
- Clients must wash their hands at the beginning of the session.    I will wash my hands before the session, use alcohol gel if I touch my face or hands or your hair or feet, wash my hands after I help you roll over, and immediately after  the session.
- I will not be performing any bare handed intra-oral, facial, or scalp massage until further notice.  These massage may be performed gloved.

I'll be using 99% isopropyl alcohol to disinfect all commonly touched surfaces: door knobs, chairs, credit card terminals, et cetera.  Also, I will be following the rest of the California Department of Public Health guidelines for personal care services to ensure all of our safety during this challenging time.
