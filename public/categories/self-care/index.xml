      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been diagnosed with major depression disorder since 2015. Before I sought care, I used to allow myself to perform my mindless, default behaviors, especially avoidant behaviors - things like staying in bed for days at a time, canceling social plans last minute. I lost many of my social connections: people gave up on me, stopped asking me to participating in things. Avoidance is a killing blow to one’s friendships, to work life, to one’s value system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So back on 17 January 2024, I was walking along a sidewalk and I was struck by an F-150 pickup truck. I was briefly knocked unconscious and blah, blah, blah, sustained some injuries and damage to my electronics. Whatever right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, not really. Although I survived, and I will get the necessary care I need to heal as much as I can, the experience compelled to do some frank and cogent examination of the state of affairs of my bodywork practice, and more importantly, my attitude toward &amp;ldquo;tending the garden,&amp;rdquo; as it were.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
